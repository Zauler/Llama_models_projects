The emulation has proven to be fast enough, to run\\nsoftware from cartridge dumps, with the same speed as the Game Boy. Most essential\\ncomponents of the Game Boy, are part of the emulation, but sound and serial port are\\nnot included in this project.

The emulation will be\\nprogrammed in Python 2.7 and will have\\nalmost the same features as the real Game\\nBoy. The sound driver and serial port will\\nnot be part of the emulation. We have cho-\\nsen to call the emulator “PyBoy”.\\nFor every emulated component, there\\nwill be a description of how it works and\\nhow the emulation of it has been made.\\nAfter the examination of the components,\\nthere will be a test section and an optimiza-\\ntion section, which go through the results\\nof the unit testing and show how the per-\\nformance has been optimized.\\n1.1 Motivation\\nAs written in the abstract, the main pur-\\npose of this project is to educate ourselves.\\nBut what can the emulator be used for?\\nDigitalbevaring.dk is a website by The\\nDanish National Archives, State and Uni-\\nversity Library and The Royal Library.\\nOne of their common goals are to pre-\\nserve current technology to save our cul-\\ntural legacy for the future[25]. With an em-\\nulator, you have the ability to display old\\ntechnology, that might become rare in the\\nfuture. By making an emulator and doc-\\numenting how it works, it will be possible\\nfor our ancestors, to understand how the\\ntechnology worked.\\nIt’s also a matter of convenience. Em-\\nulating a piece of technology can be used\\nfor ease of use or for new hardware to be\\nbackwards-compatible[8].1.2 What is a Game Boy\\nThe ﬁrst Game Boy was introduced on\\nApril 21, 1989, in Japan. The original\\nGame Boy line sold 119 million worldwide\\nas of April 2009[9].The ﬁrst Game Boy was\\ninternally dubbed “DMG-01” (Dot-Matrix-\\nGame), and these references are still visible\\non the printed circuit boards. The Game\\nBoy is equipped with a 8-bit CPU clocked\\nat 4 MHz and a monochrome, 4-tone LCD\\ndisplay[18]. Instead of installing games on\\nthe device, like you would on a personal\\ncomputer, the games come in external, re-\\nmovable cartridges. All game data, includ-\\ning saved progress, is stored in the car-\\ntridge. The cartridge consists of a volatile\\nand non-volatile memory. The game data is\\nstored on the non-volatile memory as read-\\nonly, while the saved games is stored in bat-\\ntery powered volatile memory. This is due\\nto the fact, that ﬂash memory is too expen-\\nsive at the time.[3] This choice of memory\\nalso mean, that the cartridge eﬀectively ex-\\npands the RAM/ROM bank of the Game\\nBoy.\\n1.3 Terminology\\nSince some computer architectures and\\nparadigms use diﬀerent terms for bit\\nswitching and integer notation, these tables\\nwill show the expressions used in this paper.\\nFor bit switching, we adopted the terms\\nused in the Zilog Z80 reference manual:\\nSet Switch to logical true\\nReset Switch to logical false\\nTest Reading the state of a bit.\\nFor integer notation, we use typical\\nmathematical notation for equations and\\nPython notation for code.\\nAbbreviation Python Mathematical\\nHex 0xB B16\\nDec 11 1110\\nBin 0b1011 1011 2\\n2 Emulation\\nAn emulation is an imitation of software\\nor hardware, which gives you the ability to\\n6', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\PyBoy.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

An emulator dis-\\ntinguishes from a simulator by the ability\\nto replace the original product completely.\\nThe focus of a simulator is to replicate a\\ncondition or situation[25].\\nAn example of a simulator is the Ap-\\nple iOS Simulator, which simulates the op-\\nerating system of the ARM-based iPhone.\\nThe Apple iOS Simulator can simulate the\\nconditions on the Apple iPhone, by build-\\ning the application for the modern x86-\\narchitecture, which can be run on a desktop\\ncomputer. This distinguishes it from a em-\\nulator, which would have reused the binary\\nARM-code and tried to emulate the hard-\\nware speciﬁcation of the iPhone[1]. But\\nsince the desktop CPU is much faster, than\\nthe mobile ARM CPU, this simulator can’t\\nbe used for performance tests, because the\\nsimulator doesn’t imitate the CPU restric-\\ntions of the ARM CPU.\\nOur goal is to emulate the Game Boy to\\nmakes it possible to run the software from\\nreal game cartridges, like you could on the\\noriginal Game Boy.\\n2.1 Architechture\\n2.1.1 Structure\\nNintendo ﬁled a patent in 1990, describ-\\ning in clear details, the architecture of the\\nGame Boy. Especially Fig. 4 of the patent\\n(see Figure 1) shows the integration and\\nconnection between CPU, RAM, cartridge\\nand display.\\nWith inspiration from this, we will make\\nclasses in Python, for each of these compo-\\nnents. This will set up the foundation for a\\n“guest system”, on our ‘host system”, run-\\nning Python. This guest system will be the\\nvirtual Game Boy hardware, theoretically\\ncapable of running every existing piece of\\nsoftware, written for the Game Boy.\\n2.1.2 Interconnection\\nThe real Game Boy runs all of the hardware\\nin parallel, and synchronizes through inter-\\nrupting the CPU. The interrupts work as\\nFigure 1: Architecture of the Game Boy from\\npatent by Nintendo[28, Fig. 4]\\na unidirectional message system, between\\nthe hardware parts. The LCD-controller\\nmight trigger the VBLANK-interrupt, to\\nmake the CPU do an updating routine, but\\nthe CPU can enable and disable interrupts,\\nif it’s an inconvenience to the programmer.\\nIn our software, we have a MotherBoard -\\nclass, as the ﬁrst step inside the guest\\nsystem. This class will instantiate every\\nother component of the Game Boy, like the\\nCPU,RAM,Cartridge , and Display classes.\\nThese will all be covered in detail in the\\nfollowing sections.\\nThe structure has a strict hierarchy,\\nwhere parents call functions and accesses\\nelements of children. By disallowing chil-\\ndren to make calls to their parents, we keep\\nthe code less entangled and, thereby, easier\\nto read.\\n2.1.3 Implementation\\nAs the Game Boy has an 8-bit processor,\\nand a modern computer has a 32-bit or 64-\\nbit processor, we had to ﬁgure out a way to\\nsupport the diﬀerent architectures.

Our second approach, which proved\\nto keep the time boundaries, was to use a\\nnormal integers, instead. This means, that\\non a 64-bit system, every byte would take\\nup 8 times as much memory and after ev-\\nery operation, that could possibly overﬂow\\ninto the 9thbit, we would have to mask out\\nexcessive bits. This choice would not be op-\\ntimal, if we were expecting to run the em-\\nulator on constrained hardware. We chose\\nto prioritize speed and correctness of the\\nCPU, and let it use the extra memory.\\n2.2 Partial Conclusion\\nThe initial structure is to organize the pro-\\ngram with classes, where each class repre-\\nsents its real counter part. This will yield\\na more natural ﬂow in the code, and keep\\na logic seperation of the classes. It would\\nhave been possible to make a single-class\\nprogram, but it would lose readability and\\nbecome more diﬃcult to maintain and de-\\nvelop.Having a 32-bit or 64-bit processor will\\ncause a memory penalty on the host sys-\\ntem, when emulating an 8-bit processor.\\nTo form an overview of the emulation, see\\nappendix A where there is a class map, cov-\\nering the architecture; including: Display ,\\nInteraction ,RAM,Cartridge , and CPU.\\nThese emulations will be explained in the\\nfollowing sections.\\n[25]\\n3 Central Processing Unit\\nThe CPU of the Game Boy is single cy-\\ncled, meaning it has no pipeline[13]. Un-\\nlike modern consoles and personal comput-\\ners, the Game Boy has only one processor.\\nThe Game Boy has a primitive sprite en-\\ngine, which oﬀ-loads the CPU. The CPU\\nstill has to move and load background ele-\\nments from the memory to the designated\\nvideo memory.\\n3.1 Sharp LR35902\\nThe CPU of the Game Boy was derived\\nfrom the Zilog Z80, but was modiﬁed, to\\nonly include some parts of the Z80. The\\nCPU of the Game Boy was oﬃcially named\\nLR35902 and is produced by Sharp. The\\nspeciﬁcation of the LR35902 includes a re-\\nduced instruction set and fewer registers\\nthan the Zilog Z80. The LR35902 has the\\nsame registers as the Intel 8080 (Introduced\\nin April 1974)[12], but had some of the\\nadded functionality of the Zilog Z80 (intro-\\nduced in July 1976)[24].\\n1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 Intel 8080 Zilog Z80 Intel 8086 \\nFigure 3: Release timeline of Intel 8080[12],\\nZilog Z80[24], and Intel 8086[14]\\nThe LR35902 and Z80 both uses the\\nsame instruction set from year 1974. The\\nZ80 has an 8-bit opcode length, allowing an\\ninstruction set of 256 opcodes. But by ex-\\necuting a special preﬁx instruction, called\\nopcode preﬁx , the CPU will use a diﬀerent\\nlookup table, for the next opcode.

The Intel 8080 also\\ncarries a resemblance to the modern x86\\n(ﬁrst introduced in 1978), since 8080’s suc-\\ncessor, Intel’s 8086, deﬁned the initial in-\\nstruction set of x86. The opcodes of Z80\\nand LR35902 are variable in length and are\\ndetermined by the byte-length of the op-\\ncode parameters. This means, that unlike\\nthe MIPS architecture, you can’t do ran-\\ndom lookups in the program code, without\\na known entry point.\\n3.2 Opcodes\\nThe opcodes are constructed as seen in ﬁg-\\nure 4. The dashed lines are mandatory,\\ndepending on the opcode. The preﬁx is\\nused to switch to other lookup tables. The\\nLR35902 only supports one preﬁx, which is\\ncalled the CB-preﬁx, derived from the hex-\\nadecimal value of the code.\\npreﬁx immediate immediate 8 bit 8 bit 8 bit 8 bit \\nopcode \\nFigure 4: Z80/LR35902 opcode assembly\\nThe CB-instruction set of the LR35902\\nincludes operations for rotate, swap, and\\nbit-wise test, set, and reset of registers. The\\nZ80 has 4 additional instruction sets for\\nnegations and extra load functions[23].\\nThe main instruction set includes:\\nArithmetic functions, jumps, calls, stack\\npush/pop, and control instructions.\\nThe opcode can have an immediate ap-\\npended after it. The length of the im-\\nmediate is predetermined by the opcode\\nand can be either 8- or 16-bit. In gen-\\neral, the CPU only supports unsigned in-\\ntegers, with the only exception being rel-\\native jumps and two Stack Pointer oper-\\nations. The signed data is formatted in\\ntwo’s-complement and have to be treated\\ndiﬀerently by the CPU, since every other\\ninteger is unsigned. The 16-bit immediatesare in big endian, which must be taken into\\nconsideration when building the emulator.\\n3.3 Registers\\nSome registers of the Z80 has been omitted\\nin the LR35902. The Z80 has an Alternate\\nRegister Set , in addition to the Main Reg-\\nister Set , which is 8 general purpose regis-\\nters. The Alternate Register Set is no dif-\\nferent from the main registers, but makes\\nit possible for fast context switch, by swap-\\nping the register sets. Besides the 8 general\\npurpose registers, 4 Special Purpose Regis-\\nters has been omitted. These 4 registers\\nwere used for address indexing, memory re-\\nfresh, and indirect calls by interrupt (see\\nZilog Z80 data sheet in appendix A).\\nThe registers in the LR35902 are ar-\\nranged as in ﬁgure 5.\\nBit 15 … 8 Bit 7 … 0 \\nA (acc/arg) F (ﬂags) \\nB C\\nD E\\nH (addr.)

The A\\nregister is commonly used for accumulating\\nnumbers and as argument for calls. This is\\ndue to the fact, that most 8-bit arithmetic\\nand logical instructions saves the result in\\nregister A (80 of 104 ALU instructions, in\\nthe main instruction set, use register A).\\nThe F register is a bit special, which we\\nwill get back to in a moment.

The carry ﬂag can be\\nset, when an integer overﬂows, among other\\nthings.\\nConsider the case, where register A=\\n20010andB= 250 10with the carry reset.\\nFirst, calculating the addition\\n20010+ 250 10= 450 10By taking modulo 256 of the result, we will\\nget the result capped to 8 bits.\\n45010mod 256 10= 194 10\\nDividing the previous result by 256 and\\nﬂooring the result, gives us the new carry\\nstatus.\\n⌊45010/25610⌋= 110\\nThe bit that overﬂowed will be moved to\\nthe carry and may be used in other opera-\\ntions.\\nThe carry can be used to check a jump\\ncondition. If you were to repeat a loop\\n256 times, you could initialize a register\\nto 0 and increment it with each repetition.\\nWhen reaching 256 and incrementing once\\nmore, the register would overﬂow to 0 and\\nthe carry ﬂag would be set. This would\\nmake it skip the jump and break the loop.\\nThis case showed the carry used as bor-\\nrow from an overﬂowed operation, but the\\ncarry is more than that. The carry ﬂag is\\nalso used by rotate functions, where it is\\nused as an extra bit or as a duplicate of the\\nrotated bit. One case is the Rotate Right\\nCircular ( RRC) operation. With this opera-\\ntion, the 1stbit is copied to the carry and\\nto the 8thbit, meanwhile, the other 7 bits\\nare shifted to the right.\\n01111011 0Carry Before RRC \\n10111101 1Carry After RRC \\nFigure 7: RRC operation\\n3.4.2 Load data\\nThe LR35902 supports typical load oper-\\nations, that moves data between registers\\nand between memory and registers.

The CPU supports some unusual\\ninstruction like LD (a16), SP , where a16\\nis a 16-bit unsigned integer and the paren-\\ntheses means its pointing to an address.\\nThe operation says it will load the 16-bit\\nStack Pointer to an 8-bit cell of the mem-\\nory (pointed by an 16-bit address pointer).\\nBut, the Stack Pointer is actually broken\\ninto 2×8 bits and is saved to the address\\nofa16anda16+1.\\n3.4.3 Jumps\\nA major diﬀerence from MIPS to the\\nLR35902, is how jumps and calls are han-\\ndled. While the MIPS architecture has\\n32 registers, the LR35902 is limited to 8\\nregisters[29, page 152]. In MIPS the Pro-\\ngram Counter is saved to a reserved regis-\\nter, “Return Address”, when jumping, but\\nLR35902 can’t aﬀord to reserve a single reg-\\nister for jumps. For LR35902 return ad-\\ndresses are pushed to the stack, using CALL ,\\nand popped by using RET (Return from\\ncall)[26, page 278].\\nIn addition, the LR35902 has an advan-\\ntage compared to MIPS, since it can make\\njump across its entire 16-bit memory space,\\nwhile 32-bit MIPS can only jump with 26\\nbits immediates, which doesn’t cover its 32-\\nbit memory space. MIPS does support 32-\\nbit jumps, but will require the use of a reg-\\nister to hold the 32-bit address.\\n3.5 Interrupts\\nOn hardware level, the CPU of the Game\\nBoy has just one processing core. This\\nmeans, that it has to serve a lot of diﬀer-\\nent purposes. If one were to make a game\\nwithout interrupts, it would possibly use a\\nlot of time in spinlocks and consume more\\npower (see HALT 3.5.6).\\nTimings would be close to impossible to\\ncontrol and changes in the code, would\\ncause a cascade of changes. If one were\\nto have a timer, that counted seconds,\\nwhile moving around sprites and calculat-ing game dynamics, some counters had to\\nbe used, and the time of each instruction\\nshould be accounted for.\\nInterrupts mitigates a lot of these issues\\nand leaves the programmer with more read-\\nable and eﬃcient code.\\nNone of the interrupts are mandatory to\\nserve. It’s up to the programmer to enable\\nthe interrupts, which he ﬁnds useful.\\nWhen an interrupt is triggered, the CPU\\nautomatically disables further interrupts,\\nto avoid nesting multiple interrupts. The\\nProgram Counter (PC) is automatically\\npushed to the stack and the appropriate in-\\nterrupt vector is run. It is up to the pro-\\ngrammer to reenable interrupts through the\\nEIorRETI operations. This is often done,\\nat the end of serving an interrupt.\\nIf multiple interrupts are triggered at\\nonce, the ﬁrst on the list below is served.\\nIt is undocumented, what happens with the\\nignored interrupts.

Our emulator runs on 32-bit\\nand 64-bit Python, which means, that the\\ninteger operations has to be restricted, due\\nto the 8-bit architecture.

While there are mi-\\nnor diﬀerences from MIPS to LR35902, the\\noverall layout of the opcodes remain the\\nsame. A major diﬀerence between the\\ntwo, is the register layout. While MIPS\\nhas 32 registers, LR35902 only has 8 reg-\\nisters. This doesn’t mean MIPS is objec-\\ntively better, but rather, that it follows an-\\nother paradigm. MIPS doesn’t have a ﬂags\\nregister in the same way as LR35902. On\\nMIPS, zero and overﬂow ﬂags is handled\\ndirectly by the ALU and is not saved in a\\nregister. For jumps and branches, the re-\\nsult of a comparison is taken into action\\ninstantly, while LR35902 saves the result of\\na comparison in the Fregister.\\nWhen utilizing interrupts, the CPU gains\\nlots of time for other tasks, instead of\\npolling each component for updates.

The data\\nwithin each block is read as 16 bit words\\nfrom south to north with 8 words from left\\nto right (see ﬁgure 10).

In order to speed up\\nthis otherwise time consuming process, the\\nGame Boy has special hardware to acceler-\\nate this task. The process is called a Direct\\nMemory Address (DMA) transfer. It works\\nby writing to address FF46 16with a preﬁx\\nfor the start address. The “source” is an in-\\nterval from XX00 16−XX9F 16, where XX\\nis the byte written to FF46 16.

A modern computer has 24-\\nbit color palette arranged in 1 byte for each\\nof the colors: Red, Green and Blue (RGB).\\nThis poses an incompatibility of using the\\nGame Boy graphics. Therefore, we have\\nchosen 4 shades of grey in RGB, that we\\nwill use for conversion.\\nApart from the color palette, the way the\\ndata is arranged, is also diﬀerent.\\nA traditional RGB color is arranged as an\\narray of 3 bytes, where each byte represent\\nthe intensity of each sub-pixel.\\nThe Game Boy has the pixel’s color code\\narranged across two bytes; meaning, if you\\nwere to load 8 pixels on the screen, you\\nwould load in 2 bytes – giving 2 bits per\\npixel. The leftmost of the 8 pixels would\\nget its color from the 8thbit of the ﬁrst byte\\nand the 8thbit of the second byte. The bit\\nfrom the ﬁrst byte is used as the most sig-\\nniﬁcant bit of the color code. These 2 bits\\nrepresents the grey shade of 1 pixel (see ﬁg-\\nure 24).\\nBecause of this, we will have to convert\\nthe colors from the Game Boy, before we\\ncan draw it on the screen. To do this, we\\nhave made 3 buﬀers as NumPy arrays of\\nintegers: Tile Map, Tile View 1 and Tile\\nView 2. For every frame, we run through all\\nthe bytes in the Tile Map of the Game Boy\\nand transfer them into a NumPy buﬀer.\\nFor the tile views, we copy blocks of 8 ×8\\npixels from the Tile Map’s NumPy buﬀer\\ninto the referenced places in the tile views.\\n11110101\\n10010010\\n00111110\\n11000101\\n10010111Red \\nGreen \\nBlue \\nByte 1 \\nByte 2 Pixel of orange \\n8 pixels of grey 24-bit RGB \\n2-bit Game Boy Figure 24: 24-bit Red, Green, Blue (RGB) com-\\npared to 2-bit grey-scale for the Game Boy\\nThere is no form of caching or check to\\nonly blit the areas that have changed.

There has\\nbeen made some tools to ease the debugging\\nwith tile maps and tile views. Additionally,\\nunit test has been made, which will help us\\nto prove the correctness of the implementa-\\ntion. This would also ensure, that side ef-\\nfects caused by further development, would\\nbe caught instantly.\\n9.1 Debugging\\nBesides unittests, we implemented a sim-\\nple routine to output the program counter\\nand registers for each instruction. We\\nimplemented the same routine on a com-\\npetitive emulator called Gearboy[30]. We\\nwould then search for diﬀerences in execu-\\ntion states and in that way locate bugs in\\nour code. The Gearboy is not guaranteed\\nto be correct either, but it would pin-point\\ndiﬀerences and give us a hint on where to\\nlook.\\nIf the CPU encounters a situation with\\nundeﬁned behaviour (ideally a software bug\\nin the cartridge), it would dump the entire\\nmemory, CPU state, key presses, and save\\nall SDL buﬀers as BMP.\\nIn order to debug the visual appear-\\nance, the PyBoy implementation features\\na “debug mode”, where both tile views and\\ntile maps are displayed separately from the\\ngame. This gives an overview of the loaded\\ngraphics while running the game.\\nSince the Game Boy can change tile oﬀ-\\nset and have diﬀerent ways of reading the\\nFigure 27: Screenshot of PyBoy running in de-\\nbug mode\\ntile data, bugs can easily occur. In this ex-\\nample, the oﬀset was not set correctly, and\\nall sprites were shifted (28).

Only after debugging,\\nsome of the tests passed and the emulator\\ncan now pass the tests for 10-bit operations,\\njumps, and register loads.\\nTest results are in Appendix H.\\n9.4 Partial Conclusion\\nComparing CPU states has proved to be\\nvery eﬀective. The same result could have\\nbeen achieved without it, but it speed up\\nthe debugging process substantially. A cor-\\nrectly implemented unit test would have\\ngiven the same result, but, with Gearboy,\\nwe were able to locate overseen features,\\nthat were not addressed in the unittest.The unittests has helped bringing the\\nsmall and important details up, as these\\ncan take a long time to backtrace. This\\nmade sure, we could keep progressing in\\nthe development and get closer to running\\na game. Only a few of the tests from\\nthe test-ROMs succeeded, but this does\\nnot mean that the implementation is com-\\npletely wrong and will still work in a subset\\nof programs.\\n10 Performance\\n10.1 Finding optimal datastru-\\nture\\nThis sections was found to be necessary\\nwhen the former implementation was too\\nslow compared to the Game Boy. The time\\nfor each frame was 253 milliseconds and\\nmade the emulation too slow compared to\\nthe Game Boy, which shows frames at an\\ninterval of 16.7 milliseconds (see Appendix\\nF for test results). This led to changes, that\\nimproved code performance substantially.\\n10.1.1 Test purpose\\nOur initial implementation of the opcode\\ntable, was very time consuming and we\\nfound, that lookups took the majority of\\nthe execution time of each instruction. The\\ninitial implementation had an if-statement\\nfor each type of instruction and it would\\nhave to iterate through all if-statements un-\\ntil it found the right operation. Instead,\\nwe would implement a lookup table using a\\nlist, since we already knew the integer value\\nof the opcode.\\nThe old implementation would look up\\neach opcode using an if-case like this:\\nif opcodes.NOP == inst.operation:\\n...\\nelif opcodes.EI == inst.operation:\\n...\\nelif opcodes.LD == inst.operation:\\n...\\nBy having all opcodes in a list, we would\\npotentially gain a penalty in memory usage,\\ndue to repetition. Since most of the op-\\ncodes look alike, with only minor changes,\\n28', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\PyBoy.pdf', 'page': 27}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='we would have the same function writ-\\nten multiple times. We would compensate\\nthis by making selected functions generic\\nand referencing them by a function pointer.\\nThe new implementation was drafted like\\nthis:\\nopcode = self.bootROM[pc]\\noperation = opcodes.opcodes[opcode]\\nUsing the PC as an index in the boot-ROM\\nand fetching the next instruction value.\\nThe next line would ﬁnd the opcode in the\\nop-table.\\n10.1.2 Test setup\\nThe test would benchmark the candidates\\nin the same scenarios, but with variable ta-\\nble sizes. We were interested in ﬁnding the\\nfastest static lookup table, but also when\\nto use diﬀerent tables. Our hypothesis was,\\nthat every candidate would have certain ad-\\nvantages in memory consumption, look-up\\ntime or initialization time. Our main con-\\ncern was look-up time, at this point, so ini-\\ntialization time was not in the scope of this\\ntest, nor was memory consumption.\\nThe test would measure the lookup time\\nof each list implementation with lengths of\\n2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512 el-\\nements. For each test, we would gener-\\nate a list of integers imitating opcodes and\\ngenerate lists of dummy functions imitating\\nthe Python implementation of the CPU in-\\nstructions.\\nThe test would look up all elements from\\n0 to n, where nis the length of the list.\\nThis means, that all opcodes will be looked\\nup once for each test. Each test would\\nbe repeated 30.000 times to minimize noise\\nfrom the operating system and other appli-\\ncations on the test machine. Then, an aver-\\nage of all 30.000 tests would be calculated\\nand used for the ﬁnal result.\\n10.1.3 Datatypes\\nWe wanted to test the following datatypes\\nand techniques:\\n1. NumPy Array\\n2. Lists (Python built-in)3. Tuples (Python built-in)\\n4. If-statements\\nNumPy Arrays are arranged like C-\\narrays, which means, that lookup is done\\nby calculating the byte-oﬀset from the be-\\nginning of the array. This gives an expected\\nworst-case of O(1)[21]. Python lists are a\\ncombination of linked lists and C-arrays. It\\nwill dynamically allocated more space to\\nthe list when needed, but it still manages\\nto deliver a O(1) look up time like in C-\\narrays. The reallocation isn’t a major con-\\ncern in this context, since this will only af-\\nfect initialization[10].\\nPython tuples are meant to imitate C-\\nstructs by not being mutable. The perfor-\\nmance diﬀerence in tuples and lists are not\\ndocumented, which is also one of reasons\\nfor this test[22].\\nThe if-statements are expected to be the\\nslowest solution, since a lookup have a\\nworst case of O(n), where the other can-\\ndidates have O(1).\\n10.1.4 Test results\\nFigure 29: Comparison of average lookup time\\nfor NumPy Arrays, Python lists, Python tuples\\nand If-statements (lower is better)\\nThis test shows that if-statements are\\nclearly outperformed in lookup time by the\\nother candidates. With a peak of 27.29\\nseconds, it doesn’t even come close to the\\nothers. It shows a close competition be-\\ntween the three list implementations. How-\\never, the built-in lists have a slightly lower\\nlookup time, than the two others.\\n29', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\PyBoy.pdf', 'page': 28}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The test result may look like the lookup\\ntime increased exponentially, but that is\\ndue to the fact that the tested length in-\\ncreased exponentially and the tests be-\\ncame longer proportionally to the increased\\nlength.\\nFigure 30: Comparison of average lookup time\\nfor NumPy Arrays, Python lists, and Python\\ntuples (lower is better)\\nIf we look at the data logarithmically, in-\\nstead, we will see a linear growth, which\\nsupports the claim, that the tests have in-\\ncreasing length. This veriﬁes the time com-\\nplexity to be O(1).\\n10.2 Interpreter vs. JIT\\n10.2.1 Test purpose\\nWith the initial setup, we used the Python\\ninterpreter developed by Python Software\\nFoundation. We found, that this in-\\nterpreter wasn’t able to produce enough\\nFrames Per Second (FPS) to run the emu-\\nlator. We optimized the code as described\\npreviously in section 10.1, although, this\\ndidn’t yield suﬃcient results. The FPS was\\nstill below the threshold.\\nWe searched for other Python imple-\\nmentation and found “PyPy”, that adver-\\ntised improved performance for repetitive\\noperations[11]. Since our implementation\\nwill rerun the same Fetch-Decode-Execute\\ncycle, once for every instruction in the\\nROM, our case would ﬁt this description\\nquite well.\\nSince PyPy is justanother Python imple-\\nmentation, no code had to be rewritten and\\nthe Python implementations still remain in-\\nterchangeable.10.2.2 Test setup\\nWe needed a test to compare the two\\nPython implementations and decided the\\nboot-ROM would represent a suitable test,\\nsince it has a clear start and stop point\\nand runs several loops. We could have\\nconstructed a test-ROM, that would run\\neach instruction or the most common ones,\\nbut the boot-ROM seemed like a better\\nreal-world example. The boot-ROM has\\npreparation-loops, while showing an ani-\\nmation on-screen at 60 FPS (max speed).\\nAlso, the boot-ROM doesn’t utilize inter-\\nrupts – only spinlocks. This means, that\\nthe emulators never reach an idle state, by\\ncalling HALT orSTOP .\\n10.2.3 Results\\nThe results are shown in ﬁgure 31. The\\ndelta time for each frame rendered over a\\ntotal of 355 frames. The dashed line shows\\nthe 60 FPS barrier, at which the Game Boy\\nruns. The data is the average for three runs\\neach.\\nThe graph shows an initial spike in\\ntime, which normalizes within 5-10 frames.\\nPython and PyPy both have the same spike\\nto begin with, but PyPy will decrease its\\nexecution time dramatically. Our hypote-\\nsis is, that PyPy needs a few runs in or-\\nder to start the optimization, but even with\\nPyPy’s relative speed to Python, there still\\nis a quick ﬂuctuation. When investigating\\nthe boot-ROM, we found, that the ﬁrst step\\nis to zero the VRAM, which spans 8192\\nbytes and is performed by a routine of 48\\nclock cycles.\\n8192 bytes∗48 cycles = 393216 cycles\\nThe CPU runs at an average of 4194304\\nHz[4], which means, we can calculate the\\nexpected time frame for the zeroing routine.\\n393216 cycles\\n4194304 Hz= 0.0938 seconds\\n0.0938 seconds\\n0.01667 seconds per frame= 5.625 frames\\n30', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\PyBoy.pdf', 'page': 29}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='From the execution, we estimated 5-10\\nframes, which ﬁts well with the expected\\ntime of 5.625 frames.

It is\\nnoteworthy, that both lists and tuples were\\nfaster than NumPy Arrays in every test-\\ncase.\\nPyPy made it possible to achieve desired\\nperformance without optimizing the code\\nextensively, which made it possible for usto spend more time on extending the emu-\\nlators functionality.

       " Document(page_content='11 Conclusion\\nThe Game Boy emulator has a structure, where each class represents its real counter part.\\nThis gives a more natural ﬂow in the code, and keeps a logical separation of the classes. The\\nimplementation is working on a subset of programs. An example of this is the boot-ROM,\\nwhich runs without any errors. The cartridge dump for Super Mario Land is working as well,\\nbut is only able to load the main menu, let the player press “start”, and load the ﬁrst scene.\\nAlthough, sprites are not yet implemented; therefore, the sprite of Mario is not visible.\\nThe CPU,Cartridge ,Motherboard ,RAM,Display , and Interaction has been imple-\\nmented with success. Emulating the boot-ROM turned out not to be unessential as it only\\ninitializes hardware, shows the Nintendo logo, and checks for counterfeit games. These things\\nare either way initialized by the emulator.\\nThe cartridge emulation has been found to make use of memory bank controllers. These\\ncontrollers make banking possible and extends the possibilities for games for the Game boy\\nconsiderably. Only Type 1 of the controllers is implemented with success.\\nFor the implementation of the RAM, it does not seem to have any bugs. For increased\\nﬂexibility, the RAM handles all of the memory accesses for the CPU, but redirects some\\ntasks to the cartridge and other components. This moves the complexity into specialized\\nclasses.\\nThe display part of the Game Boy seems to work fully from what we observed, on screen.\\nTiles and positions are correct on the screen, when comparing to other emulators. The\\nsprite engine and tile views allow for ﬂexible 2D graphics on the Game Boy. Even though,\\nthe possibilities to draw graphics are limited, it still produces 60 frames per second, while\\nnot using excessive time on the CPU. Because of the diﬀerence in architecture from the host\\nsystem, all these features has to be emulated in software and takes up a lot of resources.\\nThe drawing routines are a place, where optimizations will possibly have a high performance\\ngain.\\nWe experienced bad performance with the emulator during the project. We made some\\nperformance tests, which ended in a new and better implementation. The optimization\\nutilized look-up tables for decoding of opcodes. The use of the PyPy Just-In-Time compiler,\\ninstead of the Python interpreter, made it possible to achieve the desired performance. This\\nwas possible without optimizing the code extensively, which gave us more time to spend on\\nextending the emulator’s functionality.\\n32', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\PyBoy.pdf', 'page': 31}),\n",

The emulation will be\\nprogrammed in Python 2.7 and will have\\nalmost the same features as the real Game\\nBoy. The sound driver and serial port will\\nnot be part of the emulation. We have cho-\\nsen to call the emulator “PyBoy”.\\nFor every emulated component, there\\nwill be a description of how it works and\\nhow the emulation of it has been made.\\nAfter the examination of the components,\\nthere will be a test section and an optimiza-\\ntion section, which go through the results\\nof the unit testing and show how the per-\\nformance has been optimized.\\n1.1 Motivation\\nAs written in the abstract, the main pur-\\npose of this project is to educate ourselves.\\nBut what can the emulator be used for?\\nDigitalbevaring.dk is a website by The\\nDanish National Archives, State and Uni-\\nversity Library and The Royal Library.\\nOne of their common goals are to pre-\\nserve current technology to save our cul-\\ntural legacy for the future[25]. With an em-\\nulator, you have the ability to display old\\ntechnology, that might become rare in the\\nfuture. By making an emulator and doc-\\numenting how it works, it will be possible\\nfor our ancestors, to understand how the\\ntechnology worked.\\nIt’s also a matter of convenience. Em-\\nulating a piece of technology can be used\\nfor ease of use or for new hardware to be\\nbackwards-compatible[8].1.2 What is a Game Boy\\nThe ﬁrst Game Boy was introduced on\\nApril 21, 1989, in Japan. The original\\nGame Boy line sold 119 million worldwide\\nas of April 2009[9].The ﬁrst Game Boy was\\ninternally dubbed “DMG-01” (Dot-Matrix-\\nGame), and these references are still visible\\non the printed circuit boards. The Game\\nBoy is equipped with a 8-bit CPU clocked\\nat 4 MHz and a monochrome, 4-tone LCD\\ndisplay[18]. Instead of installing games on\\nthe device, like you would on a personal\\ncomputer, the games come in external, re-\\nmovable cartridges. All game data, includ-\\ning saved progress, is stored in the car-\\ntridge. The cartridge consists of a volatile\\nand non-volatile memory. The game data is\\nstored on the non-volatile memory as read-\\nonly, while the saved games is stored in bat-\\ntery powered volatile memory. This is due\\nto the fact, that ﬂash memory is too expen-\\nsive at the time.[3] This choice of memory\\nalso mean, that the cartridge eﬀectively ex-\\npands the RAM/ROM bank of the Game\\nBoy.\\n1.3 Terminology\\nSince some computer architectures and\\nparadigms use diﬀerent terms for bit\\nswitching and integer notation, these tables\\nwill show the expressions used in this paper.\\nFor bit switching, we adopted the terms\\nused in the Zilog Z80 reference manual:\\nSet Switch to logical true\\nReset Switch to logical false\\nTest Reading the state of a bit.\\nFor integer notation, we use typical\\nmathematical notation for equations and\\nPython notation for code.\\nAbbreviation Python Mathematical\\nHex 0xB B16\\nDec 11 1110\\nBin 0b1011 1011 2\\n2 Emulation\\nAn emulation is an imitation of software\\nor hardware, which gives you the ability to\\n6', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\PyBoy.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

An emulator dis-\\ntinguishes from a simulator by the ability\\nto replace the original product completely.\\nThe focus of a simulator is to replicate a\\ncondition or situation[25].\\nAn example of a simulator is the Ap-\\nple iOS Simulator, which simulates the op-\\nerating system of the ARM-based iPhone.\\nThe Apple iOS Simulator can simulate the\\nconditions on the Apple iPhone, by build-\\ning the application for the modern x86-\\narchitecture, which can be run on a desktop\\ncomputer. This distinguishes it from a em-\\nulator, which would have reused the binary\\nARM-code and tried to emulate the hard-\\nware speciﬁcation of the iPhone[1]. But\\nsince the desktop CPU is much faster, than\\nthe mobile ARM CPU, this simulator can’t\\nbe used for performance tests, because the\\nsimulator doesn’t imitate the CPU restric-\\ntions of the ARM CPU.\\nOur goal is to emulate the Game Boy to\\nmakes it possible to run the software from\\nreal game cartridges, like you could on the\\noriginal Game Boy.\\n2.1 Architechture\\n2.1.1 Structure\\nNintendo ﬁled a patent in 1990, describ-\\ning in clear details, the architecture of the\\nGame Boy. Especially Fig. 4 of the patent\\n(see Figure 1) shows the integration and\\nconnection between CPU, RAM, cartridge\\nand display.\\nWith inspiration from this, we will make\\nclasses in Python, for each of these compo-\\nnents. This will set up the foundation for a\\n“guest system”, on our ‘host system”, run-\\nning Python. This guest system will be the\\nvirtual Game Boy hardware, theoretically\\ncapable of running every existing piece of\\nsoftware, written for the Game Boy.\\n2.1.2 Interconnection\\nThe real Game Boy runs all of the hardware\\nin parallel, and synchronizes through inter-\\nrupting the CPU. The interrupts work as\\nFigure 1: Architecture of the Game Boy from\\npatent by Nintendo[28, Fig. 4]\\na unidirectional message system, between\\nthe hardware parts. The LCD-controller\\nmight trigger the VBLANK-interrupt, to\\nmake the CPU do an updating routine, but\\nthe CPU can enable and disable interrupts,\\nif it’s an inconvenience to the programmer.\\nIn our software, we have a MotherBoard -\\nclass, as the ﬁrst step inside the guest\\nsystem. This class will instantiate every\\nother component of the Game Boy, like the\\nCPU,RAM,Cartridge , and Display classes.\\nThese will all be covered in detail in the\\nfollowing sections.\\nThe structure has a strict hierarchy,\\nwhere parents call functions and accesses\\nelements of children. By disallowing chil-\\ndren to make calls to their parents, we keep\\nthe code less entangled and, thereby, easier\\nto read.\\n2.1.3 Implementation\\nAs the Game Boy has an 8-bit processor,\\nand a modern computer has a 32-bit or 64-\\nbit processor, we had to ﬁgure out a way to\\nsupport the diﬀerent architectures.

Our second approach, which proved\\nto keep the time boundaries, was to use a\\nnormal integers, instead. This means, that\\non a 64-bit system, every byte would take\\nup 8 times as much memory and after ev-\\nery operation, that could possibly overﬂow\\ninto the 9thbit, we would have to mask out\\nexcessive bits. This choice would not be op-\\ntimal, if we were expecting to run the em-\\nulator on constrained hardware. We chose\\nto prioritize speed and correctness of the\\nCPU, and let it use the extra memory.\\n2.2 Partial Conclusion\\nThe initial structure is to organize the pro-\\ngram with classes, where each class repre-\\nsents its real counter part. This will yield\\na more natural ﬂow in the code, and keep\\na logic seperation of the classes. It would\\nhave been possible to make a single-class\\nprogram, but it would lose readability and\\nbecome more diﬃcult to maintain and de-\\nvelop.Having a 32-bit or 64-bit processor will\\ncause a memory penalty on the host sys-\\ntem, when emulating an 8-bit processor.\\nTo form an overview of the emulation, see\\nappendix A where there is a class map, cov-\\nering the architecture; including: Display ,\\nInteraction ,RAM,Cartridge , and CPU.\\nThese emulations will be explained in the\\nfollowing sections.\\n[25]\\n3 Central Processing Unit\\nThe CPU of the Game Boy is single cy-\\ncled, meaning it has no pipeline[13]. Un-\\nlike modern consoles and personal comput-\\ners, the Game Boy has only one processor.\\nThe Game Boy has a primitive sprite en-\\ngine, which oﬀ-loads the CPU. The CPU\\nstill has to move and load background ele-\\nments from the memory to the designated\\nvideo memory.\\n3.1 Sharp LR35902\\nThe CPU of the Game Boy was derived\\nfrom the Zilog Z80, but was modiﬁed, to\\nonly include some parts of the Z80. The\\nCPU of the Game Boy was oﬃcially named\\nLR35902 and is produced by Sharp. The\\nspeciﬁcation of the LR35902 includes a re-\\nduced instruction set and fewer registers\\nthan the Zilog Z80. The LR35902 has the\\nsame registers as the Intel 8080 (Introduced\\nin April 1974)[12], but had some of the\\nadded functionality of the Zilog Z80 (intro-\\nduced in July 1976)[24].\\n1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 Intel 8080 Zilog Z80 Intel 8086 \\nFigure 3: Release timeline of Intel 8080[12],\\nZilog Z80[24], and Intel 8086[14]\\nThe LR35902 and Z80 both uses the\\nsame instruction set from year 1974. The\\nZ80 has an 8-bit opcode length, allowing an\\ninstruction set of 256 opcodes. But by ex-\\necuting a special preﬁx instruction, called\\nopcode preﬁx , the CPU will use a diﬀerent\\nlookup table, for the next opcode.

The Intel 8080 also\\ncarries a resemblance to the modern x86\\n(ﬁrst introduced in 1978), since 8080’s suc-\\ncessor, Intel’s 8086, deﬁned the initial in-\\nstruction set of x86. The opcodes of Z80\\nand LR35902 are variable in length and are\\ndetermined by the byte-length of the op-\\ncode parameters. This means, that unlike\\nthe MIPS architecture, you can’t do ran-\\ndom lookups in the program code, without\\na known entry point.\\n3.2 Opcodes\\nThe opcodes are constructed as seen in ﬁg-\\nure 4. The dashed lines are mandatory,\\ndepending on the opcode. The preﬁx is\\nused to switch to other lookup tables.

The length of the im-\\nmediate is predetermined by the opcode\\nand can be either 8- or 16-bit. In gen-\\neral, the CPU only supports unsigned in-\\ntegers, with the only exception being rel-\\native jumps and two Stack Pointer oper-\\nations. The signed data is formatted in\\ntwo’s-complement and have to be treated\\ndiﬀerently by the CPU, since every other\\ninteger is unsigned. The 16-bit immediatesare in big endian, which must be taken into\\nconsideration when building the emulator.\\n3.3 Registers\\nSome registers of the Z80 has been omitted\\nin the LR35902. The Z80 has an Alternate\\nRegister Set , in addition to the Main Reg-\\nister Set , which is 8 general purpose regis-\\nters. The Alternate Register Set is no dif-\\nferent from the main registers, but makes\\nit possible for fast context switch, by swap-\\nping the register sets. Besides the 8 general\\npurpose registers, 4 Special Purpose Regis-\\nters has been omitted. These 4 registers\\nwere used for address indexing, memory re-\\nfresh, and indirect calls by interrupt (see\\nZilog Z80 data sheet in appendix A).\\nThe registers in the LR35902 are ar-\\nranged as in ﬁgure 5.\\nBit 15 … 8 Bit 7 … 0 \\nA (acc/arg) F (ﬂags) \\nB C\\nD E\\nH (addr.)

The A\\nregister is commonly used for accumulating\\nnumbers and as argument for calls. This is\\ndue to the fact, that most 8-bit arithmetic\\nand logical instructions saves the result in\\nregister A (80 of 104 ALU instructions, in\\nthe main instruction set, use register A).\\nThe F register is a bit special, which we\\nwill get back to in a moment.

The carry ﬂag can be\\nset, when an integer overﬂows, among other\\nthings.\\nConsider the case, where register A=\\n20010andB= 250 10with the carry reset.\\nFirst, calculating the addition\\n20010+ 250 10= 450 10By taking modulo 256 of the result, we will\\nget the result capped to 8 bits.\\n45010mod 256 10= 194 10\\nDividing the previous result by 256 and\\nﬂooring the result, gives us the new carry\\nstatus.\\n⌊45010/25610⌋= 110\\nThe bit that overﬂowed will be moved to\\nthe carry and may be used in other opera-\\ntions.\\nThe carry can be used to check a jump\\ncondition. If you were to repeat a loop\\n256 times, you could initialize a register\\nto 0 and increment it with each repetition.\\nWhen reaching 256 and incrementing once\\nmore, the register would overﬂow to 0 and\\nthe carry ﬂag would be set. This would\\nmake it skip the jump and break the loop.\\nThis case showed the carry used as bor-\\nrow from an overﬂowed operation, but the\\ncarry is more than that. The carry ﬂag is\\nalso used by rotate functions, where it is\\nused as an extra bit or as a duplicate of the\\nrotated bit. One case is the Rotate Right\\nCircular ( RRC) operation.

The CPU supports some unusual\\ninstruction like LD (a16), SP , where a16\\nis a 16-bit unsigned integer and the paren-\\ntheses means its pointing to an address.\\nThe operation says it will load the 16-bit\\nStack Pointer to an 8-bit cell of the mem-\\nory (pointed by an 16-bit address pointer).\\nBut, the Stack Pointer is actually broken\\ninto 2×8 bits and is saved to the address\\nofa16anda16+1.\\n3.4.3 Jumps\\nA major diﬀerence from MIPS to the\\nLR35902, is how jumps and calls are han-\\ndled. While the MIPS architecture has\\n32 registers, the LR35902 is limited to 8\\nregisters[29, page 152]. In MIPS the Pro-\\ngram Counter is saved to a reserved regis-\\nter, “Return Address”, when jumping, but\\nLR35902 can’t aﬀord to reserve a single reg-\\nister for jumps. For LR35902 return ad-\\ndresses are pushed to the stack, using CALL ,\\nand popped by using RET (Return from\\ncall)[26, page 278].\\nIn addition, the LR35902 has an advan-\\ntage compared to MIPS, since it can make\\njump across its entire 16-bit memory space,\\nwhile 32-bit MIPS can only jump with 26\\nbits immediates, which doesn’t cover its 32-\\nbit memory space. MIPS does support 32-\\nbit jumps, but will require the use of a reg-\\nister to hold the 32-bit address.\\n3.5 Interrupts\\nOn hardware level, the CPU of the Game\\nBoy has just one processing core. This\\nmeans, that it has to serve a lot of diﬀer-\\nent purposes. If one were to make a game\\nwithout interrupts, it would possibly use a\\nlot of time in spinlocks and consume more\\npower (see HALT 3.5.6).\\nTimings would be close to impossible to\\ncontrol and changes in the code, would\\ncause a cascade of changes. If one were\\nto have a timer, that counted seconds,\\nwhile moving around sprites and calculat-ing game dynamics, some counters had to\\nbe used, and the time of each instruction\\nshould be accounted for.\\nInterrupts mitigates a lot of these issues\\nand leaves the programmer with more read-\\nable and eﬃcient code.\\nNone of the interrupts are mandatory to\\nserve. It’s up to the programmer to enable\\nthe interrupts, which he ﬁnds useful.\\nWhen an interrupt is triggered, the CPU\\nautomatically disables further interrupts,\\nto avoid nesting multiple interrupts. The\\nProgram Counter (PC) is automatically\\npushed to the stack and the appropriate in-\\nterrupt vector is run. It is up to the pro-\\ngrammer to reenable interrupts through the\\nEIorRETI operations. This is often done,\\nat the end of serving an interrupt.\\nIf multiple interrupts are triggered at\\nonce, the ﬁrst on the list below is served.\\nIt is undocumented, what happens with the\\nignored interrupts. Either, the CPU could\\ninterrupt again once the interrupts are en-\\nabled or it could be up to the programmer\\nto poll the interrupt register.\\nThe Game boy has 5 main interrupt\\nvectors:\\nName Cause Call\\nVBLANK LCD has drawn a frame 4016\\nLCDC LCD controller changed 4816\\nSERIAL Serial transfer completed 5016\\nTIMER Serial transfer completed 5816\\nHiToLo User pressed a button 6016\\nAll main interrupts are enabled or\\ndisabled through the register at address\\nFFFF 16.

The registers are:\\nAddress Name Function\\nFF04 16 DIV Divider Register\\nFF05 16 TIMA Timer Counter\\nFF06 16 TMA Timer Modulo\\nFF07 16 TAC Timer Control\\nThe divider register increments automat-\\nically, with a frequency of 16,384 Hz and is\\nresets, if anything is written to it. The pur-\\npose of this register is not documented, but\\nmight be used for generating pseudo ran-\\ndom numbers.\\nThe Timer Counter increments, at the\\nrate speciﬁed by TAC. When it overﬂows, it\\nresets to the value of TMAand triggers an\\ninterrupt.Timer Modulo contains the timer oﬀset.\\nSince the timer is only triggered on over-\\nﬂow, the only way to adjust the length of\\nthe timer, is to restart the timer with an\\noﬀset.\\nThe Timer Control sets the speed of the\\ntimer with a divider and tells the timer\\ncomponent to start or stop.\\nBit Function\\n0-100: 4096 Hz\\n01: 262144 Hz\\n10: 65536 Hz\\n11: 16384 Hz\\n20 = Stop\\n1 = Start\\nIf the Timer Interrupt has been enabled,\\nthe CPU will jump to address 0050 16, when\\nTIMA overﬂows. At this address, the pro-\\ngrammer has prepared a routine that de-\\ncides what to do.\\n3.5.5 HiToLo\\nWhen the user pushes a button, this inter-\\nrupt is triggered, to let the game immedi-\\nately react, to the user input. The user\\nwon’t see the changes until the next frame,\\nbut it can make the game feel more respon-\\nsive, to not lock the interaction to speciﬁc\\ntime of a frames.\\n3.5.6 HALT\\nGames are recommended to use the HALT\\noperation, to save power [17, Using the\\nHALT Instruction]. The HALT operation\\nstalls the CPU, until an interrupt is trig-\\ngered. The interrupt breaks out of the HALT\\nand the CPU is transferred to the interrupt\\nvector. When returned from the interrupt,\\nit continues with the code, right after the\\nHALT .\\n3.6 Emulation\\nThe CPU is implemented as a class, that\\ntheMotherBoard -class controls.

Our emulator runs on 32-bit\\nand 64-bit Python, which means, that the\\ninteger operations has to be restricted, due\\nto the 8-bit architecture.

While there are mi-\\nnor diﬀerences from MIPS to LR35902, the\\noverall layout of the opcodes remain the\\nsame. A major diﬀerence between the\\ntwo, is the register layout. While MIPS\\nhas 32 registers, LR35902 only has 8 reg-\\nisters. This doesn’t mean MIPS is objec-\\ntively better, but rather, that it follows an-\\nother paradigm. MIPS doesn’t have a ﬂags\\nregister in the same way as LR35902. On\\nMIPS, zero and overﬂow ﬂags is handled\\ndirectly by the ALU and is not saved in a\\nregister. For jumps and branches, the re-\\nsult of a comparison is taken into action\\ninstantly, while LR35902 saves the result of\\na comparison in the Fregister.\\nWhen utilizing interrupts, the CPU gains\\nlots of time for other tasks, instead of\\npolling each component for updates.

In order to speed up\\nthis otherwise time consuming process, the\\nGame Boy has special hardware to acceler-\\nate this task. The process is called a Direct\\nMemory Address (DMA) transfer. It works\\nby writing to address FF46 16with a preﬁx\\nfor the start address. The “source” is an in-\\nterval from XX00 16−XX9F 16, where XX\\nis the byte written to FF46 16.

The\\ndestination is ﬁxed to FE00 16−FE9F 16.\\nThe transfer takes 160 microseconds and\\nafter that, the Game Boy can use the new\\nsprites for drawing.

A modern computer has 24-\\nbit color palette arranged in 1 byte for each\\nof the colors: Red, Green and Blue (RGB).\\nThis poses an incompatibility of using the\\nGame Boy graphics. Therefore, we have\\nchosen 4 shades of grey in RGB, that we\\nwill use for conversion.\\nApart from the color palette, the way the\\ndata is arranged, is also diﬀerent.\\nA traditional RGB color is arranged as an\\narray of 3 bytes, where each byte represent\\nthe intensity of each sub-pixel.\\nThe Game Boy has the pixel’s color code\\narranged across two bytes; meaning, if you\\nwere to load 8 pixels on the screen, you\\nwould load in 2 bytes – giving 2 bits per\\npixel. The leftmost of the 8 pixels would\\nget its color from the 8thbit of the ﬁrst byte\\nand the 8thbit of the second byte. The bit\\nfrom the ﬁrst byte is used as the most sig-\\nniﬁcant bit of the color code. These 2 bits\\nrepresents the grey shade of 1 pixel (see ﬁg-\\nure 24).\\nBecause of this, we will have to convert\\nthe colors from the Game Boy, before we\\ncan draw it on the screen. To do this, we\\nhave made 3 buﬀers as NumPy arrays of\\nintegers: Tile Map, Tile View 1 and Tile\\nView 2. For every frame, we run through all\\nthe bytes in the Tile Map of the Game Boy\\nand transfer them into a NumPy buﬀer.\\nFor the tile views, we copy blocks of 8 ×8\\npixels from the Tile Map’s NumPy buﬀer\\ninto the referenced places in the tile views.\\n11110101\\n10010010\\n00111110\\n11000101\\n10010111Red \\nGreen \\nBlue \\nByte 1 \\nByte 2 Pixel of orange \\n8 pixels of grey 24-bit RGB \\n2-bit Game Boy Figure 24: 24-bit Red, Green, Blue (RGB) com-\\npared to 2-bit grey-scale for the Game Boy\\nThere is no form of caching or check to\\nonly blit the areas that have changed.

Especially, in CPU\\nemulation, we have seen, even the slight-\\nest variations from the real CPU, can pro-\\nduce largely diﬀerent outcomes. There has\\nbeen made some tools to ease the debugging\\nwith tile maps and tile views. Additionally,\\nunit test has been made, which will help us\\nto prove the correctness of the implementa-\\ntion. This would also ensure, that side ef-\\nfects caused by further development, would\\nbe caught instantly.\\n9.1 Debugging\\nBesides unittests, we implemented a sim-\\nple routine to output the program counter\\nand registers for each instruction. We\\nimplemented the same routine on a com-\\npetitive emulator called Gearboy[30]. We\\nwould then search for diﬀerences in execu-\\ntion states and in that way locate bugs in\\nour code. The Gearboy is not guaranteed\\nto be correct either, but it would pin-point\\ndiﬀerences and give us a hint on where to\\nlook.\\nIf the CPU encounters a situation with\\nundeﬁned behaviour (ideally a software bug\\nin the cartridge), it would dump the entire\\nmemory, CPU state, key presses, and save\\nall SDL buﬀers as BMP.\\nIn order to debug the visual appear-\\nance, the PyBoy implementation features\\na “debug mode”, where both tile views and\\ntile maps are displayed separately from the\\ngame. This gives an overview of the loaded\\ngraphics while running the game.\\nSince the Game Boy can change tile oﬀ-\\nset and have diﬀerent ways of reading the\\nFigure 27: Screenshot of PyBoy running in de-\\nbug mode\\ntile data, bugs can easily occur. In this ex-\\nample, the oﬀset was not set correctly, and\\nall sprites were shifted (28).

In\\nour early implementation, LDD wrongfully\\nincremented HL, instead.\\nA loop in the boot-ROM runs LDDuntil\\nthe 8th bit of H turns to zero.

This made it seem like the code\\nran ﬁne, as it continued.\\nAnother example, found in the boot-\\nROM, was a missing 8-bit mask. Most\\nALU-operations end with an 8-bit mask.\\nThis was overseen, and when the CP\\noperation checked, if register A was 0, it\\nactually compared 500 16to 0.\\nTesting\\nThe tests of the CPU has been done\\nby creating unit tests for every opcode.\\nAll tests are checking the mathematical\\ncorrectness and ﬂags.

We can conclude, that our\\nunittests doesn’t suﬃce, since running a\\ntest-ROM reveals multiple errors. This\\nis probably due to corner-cases or inade-\\nquately documented features.\\n9.2.2 Display\\nTesting the display is in common cases very\\nsimple. Compared to the CPU, a wrong-fully implemented part of the display will\\nnot have consequences for the Game Boy.\\nIf the CPU calculates something wrong,\\nit will keep working with this error, and\\nin worst case crash the Game Boy.

Our main con-\\ncern was look-up time, at this point, so ini-\\ntialization time was not in the scope of this\\ntest, nor was memory consumption.\\nThe test would measure the lookup time\\nof each list implementation with lengths of\\n2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512 el-\\nements. For each test, we would gener-\\nate a list of integers imitating opcodes and\\ngenerate lists of dummy functions imitating\\nthe Python implementation of the CPU in-\\nstructions.\\nThe test would look up all elements from\\n0 to n, where nis the length of the list.\\nThis means, that all opcodes will be looked\\nup once for each test. Each test would\\nbe repeated 30.000 times to minimize noise\\nfrom the operating system and other appli-\\ncations on the test machine. Then, an aver-\\nage of all 30.000 tests would be calculated\\nand used for the ﬁnal result.\\n10.1.3 Datatypes\\nWe wanted to test the following datatypes\\nand techniques:\\n1. NumPy Array\\n2. Lists (Python built-in)3. Tuples (Python built-in)\\n4. If-statements\\nNumPy Arrays are arranged like C-\\narrays, which means, that lookup is done\\nby calculating the byte-oﬀset from the be-\\nginning of the array. This gives an expected\\nworst-case of O(1)[21]. Python lists are a\\ncombination of linked lists and C-arrays. It\\nwill dynamically allocated more space to\\nthe list when needed, but it still manages\\nto deliver a O(1) look up time like in C-\\narrays. The reallocation isn’t a major con-\\ncern in this context, since this will only af-\\nfect initialization[10].\\nPython tuples are meant to imitate C-\\nstructs by not being mutable. The perfor-\\nmance diﬀerence in tuples and lists are not\\ndocumented, which is also one of reasons\\nfor this test[22].\\nThe if-statements are expected to be the\\nslowest solution, since a lookup have a\\nworst case of O(n), where the other can-\\ndidates have O(1).\\n10.1.4 Test results\\nFigure 29: Comparison of average lookup time\\nfor NumPy Arrays, Python lists, Python tuples\\nand If-statements (lower is better)\\nThis test shows that if-statements are\\nclearly outperformed in lookup time by the\\nother candidates. With a peak of 27.29\\nseconds, it doesn’t even come close to the\\nothers. It shows a close competition be-\\ntween the three list implementations. How-\\never, the built-in lists have a slightly lower\\nlookup time, than the two others.\\n29', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\PyBoy.pdf', 'page': 28}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The test result may look like the lookup\\ntime increased exponentially, but that is\\ndue to the fact that the tested length in-\\ncreased exponentially and the tests be-\\ncame longer proportionally to the increased\\nlength.\\nFigure 30: Comparison of average lookup time\\nfor NumPy Arrays, Python lists, and Python\\ntuples (lower is better)\\nIf we look at the data logarithmically, in-\\nstead, we will see a linear growth, which\\nsupports the claim, that the tests have in-\\ncreasing length. This veriﬁes the time com-\\nplexity to be O(1).\\n10.2 Interpreter vs. JIT\\n10.2.1 Test purpose\\nWith the initial setup, we used the Python\\ninterpreter developed by Python Software\\nFoundation. We found, that this in-\\nterpreter wasn’t able to produce enough\\nFrames Per Second (FPS) to run the emu-\\nlator. We optimized the code as described\\npreviously in section 10.1, although, this\\ndidn’t yield suﬃcient results. The FPS was\\nstill below the threshold.\\nWe searched for other Python imple-\\nmentation and found “PyPy”, that adver-\\ntised improved performance for repetitive\\noperations[11]. Since our implementation\\nwill rerun the same Fetch-Decode-Execute\\ncycle, once for every instruction in the\\nROM, our case would ﬁt this description\\nquite well.\\nSince PyPy is justanother Python imple-\\nmentation, no code had to be rewritten and\\nthe Python implementations still remain in-\\nterchangeable.10.2.2 Test setup\\nWe needed a test to compare the two\\nPython implementations and decided the\\nboot-ROM would represent a suitable test,\\nsince it has a clear start and stop point\\nand runs several loops. We could have\\nconstructed a test-ROM, that would run\\neach instruction or the most common ones,\\nbut the boot-ROM seemed like a better\\nreal-world example. The boot-ROM has\\npreparation-loops, while showing an ani-\\nmation on-screen at 60 FPS (max speed).\\nAlso, the boot-ROM doesn’t utilize inter-\\nrupts – only spinlocks. This means, that\\nthe emulators never reach an idle state, by\\ncalling HALT orSTOP .\\n10.2.3 Results\\nThe results are shown in ﬁgure 31. The\\ndelta time for each frame rendered over a\\ntotal of 355 frames. The dashed line shows\\nthe 60 FPS barrier, at which the Game Boy\\nruns. The data is the average for three runs\\neach.\\nThe graph shows an initial spike in\\ntime, which normalizes within 5-10 frames.\\nPython and PyPy both have the same spike\\nto begin with, but PyPy will decrease its\\nexecution time dramatically. Our hypote-\\nsis is, that PyPy needs a few runs in or-\\nder to start the optimization, but even with\\nPyPy’s relative speed to Python, there still\\nis a quick ﬂuctuation. When investigating\\nthe boot-ROM, we found, that the ﬁrst step\\nis to zero the VRAM, which spans 8192\\nbytes and is performed by a routine of 48\\nclock cycles.\\n8192 bytes∗48 cycles = 393216 cycles\\nThe CPU runs at an average of 4194304\\nHz[4], which means, we can calculate the\\nexpected time frame for the zeroing routine.\\n393216 cycles\\n4194304 Hz= 0.0938 seconds\\n0.0938 seconds\\n0.01667 seconds per frame= 5.625 frames\\n30', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\PyBoy.pdf', 'page': 29}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='From the execution, we estimated 5-10\\nframes, which ﬁts well with the expected\\ntime of 5.625 frames.

It is\\nnoteworthy, that both lists and tuples were\\nfaster than NumPy Arrays in every test-\\ncase.\\nPyPy made it possible to achieve desired\\nperformance without optimizing the code\\nextensively, which made it possible for usto spend more time on extending the emu-\\nlators functionality.

       " Document(page_content='11 Conclusion\\nThe Game Boy emulator has a structure, where each class represents its real counter part.\\nThis gives a more natural ﬂow in the code, and keeps a logical separation of the classes. The\\nimplementation is working on a subset of programs. An example of this is the boot-ROM,\\nwhich runs without any errors. The cartridge dump for Super Mario Land is working as well,\\nbut is only able to load the main menu, let the player press “start”, and load the ﬁrst scene.\\nAlthough, sprites are not yet implemented; therefore, the sprite of Mario is not visible.\\nThe CPU,Cartridge ,Motherboard ,RAM,Display , and Interaction has been imple-\\nmented with success. Emulating the boot-ROM turned out not to be unessential as it only\\ninitializes hardware, shows the Nintendo logo, and checks for counterfeit games. These things\\nare either way initialized by the emulator.\\nThe cartridge emulation has been found to make use of memory bank controllers. These\\ncontrollers make banking possible and extends the possibilities for games for the Game boy\\nconsiderably. Only Type 1 of the controllers is implemented with success.\\nFor the implementation of the RAM, it does not seem to have any bugs. For increased\\nﬂexibility, the RAM handles all of the memory accesses for the CPU, but redirects some\\ntasks to the cartridge and other components. This moves the complexity into specialized\\nclasses.\\nThe display part of the Game Boy seems to work fully from what we observed, on screen.\\nTiles and positions are correct on the screen, when comparing to other emulators. The\\nsprite engine and tile views allow for ﬂexible 2D graphics on the Game Boy. Even though,\\nthe possibilities to draw graphics are limited, it still produces 60 frames per second, while\\nnot using excessive time on the CPU. Because of the diﬀerence in architecture from the host\\nsystem, all these features has to be emulated in software and takes up a lot of resources.\\nThe drawing routines are a place, where optimizations will possibly have a high performance\\ngain.\\nWe experienced bad performance with the emulator during the project. We made some\\nperformance tests, which ended in a new and better implementation. The optimization\\nutilized look-up tables for decoding of opcodes. The use of the PyPy Just-In-Time compiler,\\ninstead of the Python interpreter, made it possible to achieve the desired performance. This\\nwas possible without optimizing the code extensively, which gave us more time to spend on\\nextending the emulator’s functionality.\\n32', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\PyBoy.pdf', 'page': 31}),\n",

Figure 2 shows how this memory is conf igured to eighteen 8-bit registers and four \\n16-bit registers. All Z80 CPU’s registers are implemented using static RAM. The registers \\ninclude two sets of six general-purpose register s that can be used individually as 8-bit reg-\\nisters or in pairs as 16-bit registers. There ar e also two sets of Accumulator and Flag regis-\\nters and six special-purpose registers.\\nSpecial-Purpose Registers\\nProgram Counter (PC). The program counter holds the 16-bit address of the current \\ninstruction being fetched fro m memory. The Program Counte r is automatically incre-\\nmented after its contents are transferred to the address lines. When a program jump occurs, \\nthe new value is automatically placed in the Program Counter, overriding the incrementer.\\nStack Pointer (SP). The stack pointer holds the 16-bit addr ess of the current top of a stack \\nlocated anywhere in ex ternal system RAM memory. The ex ternal stack memory is orga-\\nnized as a last-in first-out (LIFO) file. Data can be pushed onto the stack from specific \\nCPU registers or popped off of  the stack to specific CPU registers through the execution of \\nPUSH and POP instructions. The data popped from the stack is always the most recent \\ndata pushed onto it. The stack allows simple  implementation of multiple level interrupts, \\nunlimited subroutine nesting an d simplification of many ty pes of data manipulation.Figure 2.

      "\n",
      "* In Section 6.6, the partial conclusion is that the display module needs to be further explored.\n",
      "* In Section 7.9, the partial conclusion is that the LCD emulation needs to be improved.\n",
      "* In Section 8.2, the partial conclusion is that the interaction between CPU and display needs to be better understood.\n",
